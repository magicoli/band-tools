Tools for artists, bands, musicians, ...

## Description

Post types and tools for bands. Allow publishing of records with songs list. Easy enough for a single band. Complete enough for several ones.

Although you can get this plugin for free, buying it will fund development and help providing future features.

### Goals

I am a singer, and a web designer. There are many plugins and themes for bands out there, but I found none suiting my needs. Either way too complicate, either lacking features that seem essential to me.

I wanted something:

- very simple. Let's talk about bands, records and songs and link them together
- opened to my other needs: sell my records
- theme-agnostic
- e-commerce agnostic (although I focus first on WooCommerce integration, Easy Digital Downloads might follow)

### Features

- "band", "record" and "song" post types, with relationships
- Bands, Records and Songs available for navigation menus
- Bands, Records and Songs can be used as home page (bands are allowed by default, others are activable in settings)
- Widgets, shortcodes and WPBakery blocks to display
  - album list with songs, buy link, player
  - related items (songs in displayed album, albums of displayed band...)
- Audio player for albums
  - Playlist for albums
  - Play button for each song in album
- Customizable layouts for bands, records and songs
- WooCommerce integration
  - Links to products or external shop page
  - Buy link, per album or per song

### Artists using this plugin

- [Olivier van Helden](https://van-helden.net/)
- [Cendryn](https://cendryn.fr/)
- [Thierry Hodiamont](https://thierryhodiamont.be/)
- [Thierry Hercod](https://thierryhercod.com/)

## Roadmap

### Next moves

- Better widgets: cleaner and more complete display (thumbnails for bands, direct buy or link, ...)
- Video player
- External product links (to specific online store and common distribution platforms)
- Guttenberg Blocks
- Automatic submenus for bands, records and songs

### Future plans

- Video playlists for songs from YouTube, Vimeo etc.
- Crowdfunding based on WC sales (might be in a separate plugin)
- Links between different Band Tools enabled websites
- Events
- Network / Multisite integration
